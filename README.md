Personal Excel and LibreOffice Templates

The Calculations Template file has macros that automatically name cells in the "Values" column after the symbol next to it, so formulas can look like "=b\*t^3/12" instead of "=C7\*C23^3/12"

The Populate Table file has a macro to automatically plug lists of input values into your calculation and create lists of output values. Good for creating graphs or seeing trends.

.xlsm files are for Excel, .ods files are for LibreOffice.
